## Project Scope

This application is intended to show up to date information on the Covid-19 pandemic in one place.<br/>
This application includes:
  - The latest Youtube video updates from the CDC
  - The latest tweets from CDC
  - News articles pertaining to the COVID-19 Pandemic
  - Current US totals for Positive Test, Total Deaths, and Total Deaths
  - Each state's, and US territorie's Positive Test, Total Deaths, and Total Deaths current totals
      - 14 Day Historical Chart Positive Tests
  - Current country totals for Positive Tests and Recovered Patients
  - A map of testing sites in US per state
    

### `Challenges`

- Finding creditable API/Datasets for Covid-19 information
- Styling
  - Responsiveness
  - Use of different CSS frameworks
- Finding an API that contained testing sites for each state
- React.js syntax
- Transfering API data in a chart and making it dynamic
- An API depreciated the week before we presented this project,
  causing us to drop an entire component


### `Wins`
- We were able to connect multiple APIs in a single component(CovidData Component)
- Made the chart dynamic, State Name, 14(+test) information changes with state selection from the drop down box
- Created a responsive site using CSS grid
- Made all of the different CSS frameworks work together for a seemless flow to the application
- Team work and Collaboration
